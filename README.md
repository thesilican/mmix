# mmix

An implementation of Donald Knuth's [MMIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMIX) RISC computer architecture written in C :)

MMIX is a minimal computer architecture designed for educational purposes. It was designed to be simple and elegant so that it is easy to learn, yet complete enough to enable high performance in practice. It is similar in structure to other RISC architectures, like ARM or RISC-V.

## Building

```
$ make
```

The output binary is `bin/mmix`.
